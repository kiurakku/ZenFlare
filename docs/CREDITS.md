# ZenFlare Credits & Acknowledgments

ZenFlare was created with inspiration and ideas from the following.

---

## Cloud9

**Attribution:** Cloud-based IDE and a quiet, focused developer experience.

Cloud9 (and the idea of coding in the cloud with minimal friction) influenced the ZenFlare vision: reduce context switching, keep the developer in a single flow, and avoid noise. The “Zen zone” and “no noise, just flow” ideas align with that tradition.

## ARS7 Team

**Attribution:** Architecture and vision of the “full calm” platform.

The ARS7 team contributed to the conceptual architecture and the goal of a single platform for “full calm” — one flow from writing to production to support, with minimal cognitive load and clear, calm feedback (e.g. one message instead of log floods, calm dashboard instead of chaotic graphs).
