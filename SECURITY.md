# Security

ZenFlare takes security seriously. If you believe you have found a vulnerability, we ask that you report it responsibly.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not** open a public issue for security-sensitive bugs.

- **Preferred:** Open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/kiurakku/ZenFlare/security/advisories/new) (if available) or contact the maintainers privately (e.g. via the email or contact listed in the repo profile).
- Describe the issue, steps to reproduce, and impact if possible.
- We will acknowledge and work with you on a fix and disclosure timeline.

---

## Scope

- ZenFlare IDE Extension (e.g. local data, refactor API calls).
- ZenFlare Deploy (build pipeline, hosting, webhooks).
- ZenFlare Observability (log ingestion, alerts, dashboard).

---

## Out of scope

- Third-party services we integrate with (report to them).
- General configuration or usage questions (use Issues or Discussions).

Thank you for helping keep ZenFlare safe.
